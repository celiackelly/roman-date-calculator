# Roman Date Converter

A React app that converts dates on the Gregorian calendar (in English) to dates using the ancient Roman calendar (in Latin). 
- Users can choose to display the year in secular notation (B.C.E. / C.E.), Christian notation (B.C. / A.D.), or *ab urbe condita* (from the founding of the city of Rome). 
- Once the date is converted, users can also toggle between the full date and an abbreviated version.
